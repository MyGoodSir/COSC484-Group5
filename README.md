## Description
This is the codebase for a group project assigned in COSC484: Web-based Programming, taught by [Jal Irani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jalirani/) at Towson University during the Spring semester of 2022.

Our goal is to create a web application that can provide users with a list of recipies talored to the specific ingredients that the user has on hand at the moment.

The project is still currently under development.
